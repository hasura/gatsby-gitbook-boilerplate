## The Six Realms of Existence 

 

### Narakas 

Narakas (Sanskrit: नरक; Pali: निरय Niraya) are hell realms which exist to house those punished for their crimes and bad karmic actions in previous lives. Occupants are tortured and occupancy can last tens of thousands of years. These realms have not always existed, they arise into existence due to bad karmic actions.

### Animal Realm 

Past sins here are expiated by living as an animal for several generations who cannot generate good karma but only work off the bad. This lack of control is undesirable. A life lived with ignorance leads to a life of suffering. 
 

### Human Realm 

The human realm is the only one where agency for choices will affect future rebirth - all other realms are either rewards or punishments for these choices. Humans live a life long game of survival, hunger, violence and suffering but can deal with these problems as they come. More favourable than the lower realms. 
 

### Asura Realm 

Powerful but often immoral beings, the asuras are titans or war gods who live longer and are more powerful than humans but are consumed by anger. They are squander their chances at success since they are jealous of the real gods and are driven by greed and power. They are seen as a manifestation of anger. 
 

### Deva Realm 

There are a smaller amount of these heaven realms than the hell realms. Very good karma in your past lives allows you to be reborn as a god/deva in the heaven realms. The higher you ascend in these realms the more vague concepts of gender and physical presence become. They live extremely long and happy lives, but also age and die to be reborn back into the cycle of samsara. 

 

### Realm Of Hungry Ghosts 

These ghost beings are perpetually hungry but can due to their thin throats can never satisfy their hunger. Each time they attempt to something they instead vomit fire. They are reborn here due to excess greed in their past lives.  
 

 

## Karma 

A law or reality such as gravity, natural consequences to every action. A law of reality sown into universe - how things operate naturally. 
 
 

## Samsara 

This principle dictates that all beings in all realms will continue to move between realms, following a path in the cycle. There is no start or end to this process, it just keeps looping. By understanding this truth of the universe, Buddha created teachings to help beings get off of the wheel of samsara. 

*Where does the Buddha go after he dies? We cannot even conceive of answer, he is not alive or dead.* 
 

## Three Marks of Existence 

    Anicca - Impermanence - All things are in constant flux. Humans embody this flux through aging and the cycle of birth and death. 

     

    Dukkha - Suffering - All beings stuck in the cycle of rebirth suffer an unsatisfactory life. Any efforts to alleviate this suffering by fulfilling desires will eventually prove fruitless as desire for more will return. 

     

    Anatta - Non-self - The doctrine which states that there is no permanent, unchanging self in humans or physical beings or any abiding essence in anything 

 

The phrase sabbe dhamma anatta implies that the "self" in every being must be destroyed to end Dukkha.

## Anecdotes 

### Kisa Gotami 

After losing her only child, Kisa Gotami was perceived to have gone insane with grief. She sought the Buddha for help, bringing the body of her dead infant with her. The Buddha told her that he would only be able to revive her child if she could return her village and bring back all the white mustard seeds she could find from families that have not experienced death. After realizing that there was not a single family free from mortality, she returned to the Buddha and awakened to the first stage in realizing the true nature of existence. She eventually became an arhat.
