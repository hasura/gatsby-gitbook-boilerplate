##History 

The early Buddhist ethos was that liberation is in fact possible. Therefore the goal became to awaken all beings, not just yourself. It was never dominant in India. While Mahayana means Great Vehicle, those part of this school refer to other Buddhists are hinayana. Mahayana rose up as a collection of trends, not as a unified school. They had separate origins, mutual influence and various Buddhist combinations of new practices, interpretations and concepts. There were various background influences: 

    Field of merit centered around Buddha 

    Bodhisattva path leading to Buddhahood 

    Importance of vows 

    Insight into dependent origination and no-self 

    Multiple Buddhas of the past and future 

    Importance of compassion 

    Boundlessness of the universe 

    Use of personalized teachings by Buddha 

    The mind being naturally pure 

    Veneration of Buddha as a powerful, awe-inspiring spiritual figure 

 

##Beliefs 

    Under Mahayana, the goal of Buddhists is to attain Buddhahood not arhathood.  

    Many wise Buddhas and bodhisattvas exist to help all beings 

    All things are completely empty of self-nature 

    Goal of Buddhism is to awaken all beings 

    Laypeople can fully awaken like monks 

 

Indra's net can be used as a metaphor for the interpenetration of Buddhist philosophies. The Vedic deva Indra possess a infinite net of cords which hangs above the axis mundi of Buddhist and Hinduist cosmology, there is a jewel at every vertex which recursively reflect each other infinitely. 

 

##Scriptures 

The school relied on earlier Vinaya, Sutra and Abhidharma collections. New Sutras written in India, Central Asia and China were also added with time. The major Mahayna Sutras are: 

    Prajnaparamita (Perfection of Wisdom) 

    Vimalakirti 

    Lankavatara (Descent into Sri Lanka) 

    Saddharmapundarika (Lotus) 

    Sukhavati (Bliss-land) 

    Avatamsaka (Flower Necklace) 

 

##Bodhisattva Path 

Bodchitta is a state of mind, orientation that you want arouse In yourself and keep strong, it is an aspiration for all beings to achieve Buddhahood. The mind should not see any separation between itself and others. Due to this, other beings should be helped since they are connected to you. The Buddha nature indicates that all beings possess an innate capacity to awaken. 

 

### Bodhisattva Vows

    However endless delusions are, I vow to end them 

    However boundless teachings are, I vow to master them 

    However impossible the Buddha’s way is, I vow to attain it 

 

The Bodhisattva does not need to be a monk or a nun.
