#### Reason for implementing GPSM application
Legacy application Ecatalog replaced by GPSM. If suppliers upload any product in Ecatalog, process nearly takes 1 week approximately to reflect in marketplace. Also it involves lot of manual interventions. GPSM introduced for the above reasons. In GPSM, suppliers uploaded the product reaches the marketplace in real time.It atmost reduces all the manual interventions and reduces the supplier's/MM time.
